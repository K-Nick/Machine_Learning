# Machine_Learning

My Practice about Machine Learning

Algorithms which I have implemented:

* Percetron
* K Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree
* AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)
* Boosting Tree
* SVM (Supported Vecter Machine)

``` python
python ./tester.py
```

You can test these implementation with the corresponding test file which I name it with `tester.py` in each directory.

If you find any thing wrong with my program, you are welcome to touch me by e-mail: jasonleaster@163.com

Thank you :)

Yours, EOF
