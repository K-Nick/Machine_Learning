# Machine_Learning

My Practice about Machine Learning

Algorithms which I have implemented:

* AdaBoost
* K Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree
* Percetron

You could test these implementation with the corresponding test file which I name it with tester.py in each directory.

If you find any thing wrong with my program or other suggestion, you are welcome to touch me by e-mail: jasonleaster@163.com

Thank you :)

Yours, EOF
