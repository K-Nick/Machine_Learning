My Practice about Machine Learning

Algorithms which I have implemented:

* Percetron
* K Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree
* Naive Bayesian
* AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting, Real Number Version.)
* Boosting Tree
* SVM (Supported Vecter Machine. Base on SMO algorithm)

``` python
python ./tester.py
```

You can test these implementation with the corresponding test file which I name it with `tester.py` in each directory.

You could calculate the accuracy of this algorithm like what I have done.
The picture below there is the accuracy of AdaBoost with test file `tester6.py`

If you find any thing wrong with my program, you are welcome to touch me by e-mail: jasonleaster@163.com

Thank you :)
